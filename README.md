# Forg

Forg - Files Orgaiser 

This is a python script that organises your downloads folder (or any other folder you run it into) to folders.

This helps de-clutter the folders by setting folders with the date.

This can run as a scheduled task or manually. 

Command: python3 forg.py all (for all files to be moved automatically) or python3 forg.py <filename with extension> <filename2 with extension> ... (for specific files)
